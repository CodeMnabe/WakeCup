              <h1>Our Journey</h1>
              <p>
                The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after experiencing
                some of the finest coffees on an educational trip to Brazil and
                the South Americas. We wanted to break the monotony of low
                profile, non-descript coffee that was doing rounds in those
                cafeterias of the 80s. But life threw us in a different
                direction, and we ended up in the tech industry with a desire to
                get into the world of coffee someday. In 2005, that dream was
                brought to fruition when we quit our jobs and started WakeCup.
